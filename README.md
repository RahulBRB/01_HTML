# 01_HTML
Some basic conceptual files that I made while I was learning HTML, nothing interesting..<br>

**Note:** The contents and codes are not organized in the html files, it's a mess basically. I was adding new concepts in the same index file that I started with, so most of the parts are similiar. This repo is just for storing these files.
